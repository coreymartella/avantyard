				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Avant Yard we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
				<ul>
								<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. </li>
								<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
								<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
								<li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>

								<li>It is Avant Yard’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</li>
								</ul>
				<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
				<p>Like most website operators, Avant Yard collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Avant Yard’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Avant Yard’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Avant Yard may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

				<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
				<p>Certain visitors to Avant Yard’s websites choose to interact with Avant Yard in ways that require Avant Yard to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Avant Yard gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, our contact form asks you to provide a phone number and email address. In each case, Avant Yard collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Avant Yard. Avant Yard does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

				<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
				<p>Avant Yard may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Avant Yard may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Avant Yard does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

				<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
				<p>Avant Yard discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Avant Yard’s behalf or to provide services available at Avant Yard’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Avant Yard’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Avant Yard will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Avant Yard discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Avant Yard believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Avant Yard, third parties or the public at large. If you have supplied your email address via our contact form, Avant Yard may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new services and discounts, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Avant Yard and our company. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Avant Yard takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

				<h3>Cookies</h3>
				<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Avant Yard uses cookies to help Avant Yard identify and track visitors, their usage of Avant Yard website, and their website access preferences. Avant Yard visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Avant Yard’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Avant Yard’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

				<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
				<p>If Avant Yard, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Avant Yard goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Avant Yard may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

				<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
				<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Avant Yard may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Avant Yard’s sole discretion. Avant Yard encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
